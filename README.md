These models are intended to be rendered, then printed, milled, or otherwise made
physical so they can hold small ornaments or other such objects. I have taken
lengths to make the physical object sturdy, however I will not offer a warranty
or guarantee that the physical object you make will be. Please test your object.

These scad files were created with "openSCAD" version 2021.01

The two .scad files should (most probably) need to be rendered and made physical before
placing the rendered object from ornamentArm.scad (arm) into the ornamentBase.scad (base).
The two could be produced physically as one piece, but I don't because it makes printing 
slower, packaging awkward, and print design more complicated.

The ornamentHolder-C.svg file is needed, required, referenced, and wanted by ornamentArm.scad. Place ornamentHolder-C.svg in the same directory as
ornamentArm.scad before rendering.
